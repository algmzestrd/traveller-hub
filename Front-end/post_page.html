groups, and so on. Second, what actions are available to them? All actions that the players
might take that could affect any player’s payoffs should be listed. Third, what is the timing
of the interactions? Are actions taken simultaneously or sequentially? Are interactions
repeated? The order of play is also important. Moving after another player may give player
i an advantage of knowing what the other player has done; it may also put player i at a
disadvantage in terms of lost time or the ability to take some action. What information do
different players have when they take actions? Fourth, what are the payoffs to the various
players as a result of the interaction? Ascertaining payoffs involves estimating the costs and
benefits of each potential set of choices by all players. In many situations it may be easier
to estimate payoffs for some players (such as yourself) than others, and it may be unclear
whether other players are also thinking strategically. This consideration suggests that careful
attention be paid to a sensitivity analysis.</p>
